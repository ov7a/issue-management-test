# issue-management-test
a repository for issue management and other GitHub experiments

Purpose: forbid creating issues without labels & prs without milestones

1. md templates - doesn't work
2. md templates + config - doesn't work
3. md templates + issue_template.md - doesn't work (template is filled, but no labels)
4. yml form - works. Collaborators can create an empty issue, external users can't
